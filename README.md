# Crime_MD_Project
 Visualization of Crime in Maryland

This file contains visualizations using Power BI and the files from Kaggle.

The purpose of this project is to improve:

1) Knowledge in Data Cleaning and Transforming Data
2) Creating Visuals using Power BI
3) Making meaniful conclusions

I am interested in this particular subject because I would like to see how data could help anticipate crimes and prevent them from happening.

Steps:

1) Determine questions:

a) Where does crime occur the most
b) What type of crimes occur the most
c) When do crimes occur the most
d) What demographic performs the most crimes
e) Why are crimes being commited at the certain area? (This question would be better answered with more data regrading the surrounding area's living conditions, etc.)

2) Determine Queries:

Crimes - division_number, crime_code, crime_description, modulus_operandi
Victims - division_number, victim_age, victim_sex, victin_descent, status, status description
Method - modulus_operandi, weapon_code, weapon_description
Location - crime_code, division_number, latitude, longitude

3) Create Visuals
4) Answer Questions
